In this directory are .pdb and .pdbqt files that can be used for PLAIG's demo program. Files submitted to PLAIG need to be fully hydrogenated before binding affinity prediction can be performed on them. To simplify the demo process, we have included protein and ligand files for 5 different protein-ligand complexes. Please download all 4 files if you want to test the binding affinity prediction for a specific complex.
