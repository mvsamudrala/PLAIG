Welcome to the GitHub repository for PLAIG: <u>**P**</u>rotein-<u>**L**</u>igand Binding <u>**A**</u>ffinity Prediction using a Novel <u>**I**</u>nteraction-Based <u>**G**</u>raph Neural Network Framework. PLAIG can predict the binding affinity for protein-ligand complexes.<br>
Please click and open the PLAIG_demo.ipynb for PLAIG's documentation and user guide. In addition, users can test PLAIG's algorithm with their own 3D-coordinate files in .pdb and .pdbqt format.
