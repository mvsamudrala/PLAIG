# PLAIG
Welcome to the GitHub repository for PLAIG: **P**rotein-**L**igand Binding **A**ffinity Prediction using a Novel **I**nteraction-Based **G**raph Neural Network Framework.
PLAIG can predict the binding affinity for protein-ligand complexes. Please click and open the PLAIG_demo.ipynb for PLAIG's documentation and user guide. In addition, users can test PLAIG's algorithm with their own 3D-coordinate files in .pdb and .pdbqt format.
